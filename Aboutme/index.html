            <p class="paragraph">Full Name: Abdelrahman Walied Abdelrahman Mohammed Mohammed Hasssan <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live in Alexandria, Egypt. Currently pursuing Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications Enginnering at Alexandria higher Institute of Engineering and Technology (<a href="http://www.aiet.edu.eg/" style="color: blue" target="_blank">AIET</a>).</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My passion to computer science began when I was in preparatory school. I was trying to figure out how to hack video games for fun. That's was when I knew about what a programming language is. Through curios researching I made my decision to learn C. I looked it up on Google and found some Youtube courses and began understanding how to deal with it. By the time I finished the part of file processing, I was trying to learn other languages as well, such as: Python, C++, DOS Batch Script. I wanted to know what the difference between each one was and when to use each one. The same was with HTML and CSS. Through the period of high school, I put my efforts of learning the basics of each language but not getting into advanced topics. (was a wrong step) before my last year in high school, I ended up with a bundle of basics of several languages without knowing what to do next, or where to proceed after that. I waited till I finished high school as the study load was enormous and began researching more till I was introduced to problem solving -HackerRank platform to be specific-. That's when I first started practising what I've learned. I also knew about different Operating Systems, and began to learn Linux on a VM till I was confident enough to work on it as my host OS. Through this period I was testing what I can do with my PC and what Its limits are. By the time I entered college, I had the enough knowledge to know where to search if I needed any information.</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I joined AIET, I figured out that for upskilling my current level I've to take place in volunteering groups. I searched for a while before finding out that we have a Google DSC chapter. I enrolled, made friendships, and people who helped me learn more about the institute and the volunteering world. I finished my first year and ran into the pandemic. I made sure that I get the most benifit I can get from the oppurtonities that different platforms offered, such as: Udemy, Coursera, Future Learn, ..etc. I ended the summer with enough knowledge about Data Analysis, IT, and Cloud Computing. I also tried to work at a local PC repair workshop to apply my gained knowledge about hardware from these courses, and I came out with alot of experience. for the period after that and till now, I'm preparing my studies in Electronics, Communications, and Software Engineering as I'm looking forward to get a role in the expanding world of IT & DevOps.</p>
